# Description
This code is a menu translator for an Italian restaurant. It first prompts the user to either display the menu, enter a translation, or look for a definition. Once input is read, it is then passed via functions to perform the requested task. The define() and translate() functions use a DFA to parse through the strings. 

# How to Compile
Download the files from Git and place them all in a folder. Then, in your terminal, call the directory you have these files in. Once there, simply type 'make' into the command line and press enter. Then, type './FinalProject' and hit enter. This will begin the program.

#How to Test
After compiling as above, simply follow the prompts given to the user. Press 1 to see the menu, 2 to translate, and 3 to define. When typing a word to translate or define, make sure you only enter a word that is seen on the menu. Make sure only the first letter is capitalized and the word is spelled as it is on the menu. Enter 0 to return to main menu then enter 4 to exit the program.
